# Test Suite Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Baa compiler project. The testing infrastructure is designed to ensure reliability, correctness, and maintainability of all compiler components from preprocessing through AST generation.

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every implemented feature must have corresponding tests
2. **Integration Focus**: Test the complete pipeline, not just individual components
3. **Real-World Validation**: Use actual Baa language code samples for testing
4. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
5. **Documentation-Driven**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior

### Testing Pyramid
```
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │  Integration    │  ← Complete pipeline tests
    │     Tests       │
    ├─────────────────┤
    │   Component     │  ← Individual module tests
    │     Tests       │
    ├─────────────────┤
    │   Unit Tests    │  ← Function-level tests
    └─────────────────┘
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
**Purpose**: Test individual functions and data structures in isolation.

**Coverage Areas**:
- AST node creation and destruction
- Memory management functions
- String manipulation utilities
- Type system functions
- Individual parser functions
- Lexer token generation
- Preprocessor directive handling

**Location**: `tests/unit/`
**Status**: ✅ Partially implemented (AST types, utils)

### 2. Component Tests
**Purpose**: Test entire modules and their interactions.

**Coverage Areas**:
- Lexer: Complete tokenization of Baa source code
- Parser: AST generation from token streams
- Preprocessor: Macro expansion and directive processing
- AST: Node relationships and tree structure validation
- Type System: Type checking and conversion

**Location**: `tests/component/`
**Status**: ⏳ To be implemented

### 3. Integration Tests
**Purpose**: Test the complete compiler pipeline end-to-end.

**Coverage Areas**:
- Source Code → Preprocessor → Lexer → Parser → AST
- Error propagation through the pipeline
- Source location tracking accuracy
- Memory management across components

**Location**: `tests/integration/`
**Status**: ⏳ To be implemented

### 4. Regression Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure previously fixed bugs don't reoccur.

**Coverage Areas**:
- Known bug scenarios
- Edge cases that previously failed
- Performance regression detection

**Location**: `tests/regression/`
**Status**: ⏳ To be implemented

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 5: Coverage and Quality (Priority 2.5.7-2.5.8)
- [ ] Test coverage analysis
- [ ] Coverage reporting
- [ ] Quality metrics
- [ ] Continuous integration setup

## Test Data Strategy

### Sample Programs
Create a comprehensive library of Baa language programs covering:

**Basic Language Constructs**:
- Variable declarations with different types
- Arithmetic and logical expressions
- Control flow statements (when implemented)
- Function definitions (when implemented)

**Edge Cases**:
- Empty programs
- Programs with only comments
- Programs with syntax errors
- Programs with semantic errors

**Real-World Examples**:
- Simple algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Mathematical computations
- String processing
- Data structure operations

### Test Data Organization
```

├── data/
│   ├── valid/          # Valid Baa programs
│   │   ├── basic/      # Simple language constructs
│   │   ├── complex/    # Advanced features
│   │   └── examples/   # Real-world programs
│   ├── invalid/        # Programs with errors
│   │   ├── syntax/     # Syntax errors
│   │   └── semantic/   # Semantic errors
│   └── edge_cases/     # Boundary conditions
└── expected/           # Expected outputs/ASTs
```

## Coverage Goals

### Minimum Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 90% line coverage for all implemented functions
- **Component Tests**: 100% of public API functions
- **Integration Tests**: All major code paths through the pipeline
- **Error Handling**: All error conditions and recovery paths

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Execution Time**: < 30 seconds for full suite
- **Memory Leaks**: Zero tolerance for memory leaks
- **Test Reliability**: 99.9% pass rate on clean builds
- **Documentation**: Every test case documented with purpose and expected behavior

## Tools and Infrastructure

### Testing Framework
- **C Testing**: Custom framework based on assert macros
- **Test Runner**: CMake/CTest integration
- **Coverage Analysis**: gcov/llvm-cov integration
- **Memory Testing**: Valgrind/AddressSanitizer integration

### Continuous Integration
- **Build Verification**: All tests must pass before merge
- **Coverage Reporting**: Automatic coverage report generation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution time trends
- **Artifact Management**: Store test results and coverage reports

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase is considered complete when:
1. All planned tests are implemented and passing
2. Coverage targets are met
3. Documentation is updated
4. Code review is completed

### Overall Success Metrics
- **Reliability**: Zero critical bugs in tested code paths
- **Maintainability**: New features can be tested within 1 day of implementation
- **Confidence**: Developers can refactor with confidence in test coverage
- **Quality**: Test suite catches regressions before they reach main branch

## Timeline and Dependencies

### Dependencies
- **CMake/CTest**: Build system integration
- **Existing Components**: Preprocessor, Lexer, Parser, AST
- **Test Data**: Sample Baa programs and expected outputs
- **Documentation**: Updated component documentation

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 3-5 days (Framework setup)
- **Phase 2**: 5-7 days (Unit test expansion)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 days (Component testing)
- **Phase 4**: 4-6 days (Integration testing)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 days (Coverage and quality)

**Total Estimated Time**: 17-25 days

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Phase 1 with testing framework development
2. **Short-term**: Establish test data management and execution infrastructure
3. **Medium-term**: Expand unit test coverage for all implemented components
4. **Long-term**: Implement comprehensive integration testing and quality metrics

This roadmap will be updated as testing infrastructure evolves and new requirements are identified.
